# CRUD-Application
A CRUD APPLICATION (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application is a fundamental software application that allows users to perform basic operations on data stored in a database. The application is built using modern web development technologies, including React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.
